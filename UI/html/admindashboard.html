      <p>
        In the past, billions of Naira have been wasted while conducting elections due to the cost of election materials and the payment of the election officials.
        Despite all the money spent, there have been a lot of discrepancies associated with the election results. Today,
        Nigerians find it very difficult to believe that elections can be conducted without any form of rigging. <br>
        <br>
        This project is intended to help the Nigerian government to reduce the rate of stress and corruption in subsequent elections.
