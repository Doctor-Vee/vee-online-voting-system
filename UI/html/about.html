      <h2>About Vee Online Voting System (VOVS)</h2>
      <p>
        The Nigerian government is tired of using manual method for voting in their candidates due to the continual
        stress it creates and the high rate of rigging in elections. In the past, billions of Naira have been spent
        conducting elections due to the cost of election materials and for the payment of the election officials.
        Despite all the money spent, there have been a lot of discrepancies associated with the election results. Today,
        Nigerians find it very difficult to believe that elections can be conducted without any form of rigging. <br>
        <br>
        I have hereby decided to build an online voting system for the Nigerian government so as to reduce the rate of
        stress and corruption in subsequent elections. This is also intended to help reduce cost greatly. <br> <br>
